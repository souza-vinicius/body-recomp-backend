### US2 Acceptance #1: Weekly Measurement Logging
- [ ] User can log weekly measurements at least 7 days after goal creation
- [ ] Measurements are accepted with all required fields (weight, method, circumferences/skinfolds)
- [ ] Body fat percentage is recalculated for each new measurement

### US2 Acceptance #2: Progress Comparison
- [ ] System compares new measurement to previous week
- [ ] Body fat change calculated (new - previous)
- [ ] Weight change calculated (new - previous)
- [ ] Progress percentage calculated ((initial - current) / (initial - target) * 100)

### US2 Acceptance #3: Progress Visualization
- [ ] User can view all historical progress entries
- [ ] Trend chart data available with all weekly data points
- [ ] Data includes week number, body fat %, weight
- [ ] Smoothed data (moving average) provided for clearer trends

### US2 Acceptance #4: Progress Feedback
- [ ] System calculates average weekly rate of change
- [ ] Projects weeks remaining based on actual progress
- [ ] Flags if progress slower than expected (adjustment suggestions)
- [ ] Flags if progress faster than expected (warning about safety)

### US2 Acceptance #5: Goal Completion
- [ ] Goal marked as "completed" when target body fat reached
- [ ] Completion date recorded
- [ ] Cannot create new progress entries on completed goal
